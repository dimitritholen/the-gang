# SDLC Workflow Gap Analysis
**Date**: 2025-10-23
**Analysis Type**: Deep SDLC Coverage Review

## Executive Summary

The current workflow provides **world-class coverage** for:
- Requirements gathering (5-level framework)
- Technology research (comparative analysis with source grounding)
- Implementation planning (WBS, dependency mapping)
- Scope protection (MVP validation, creep prevention)
- Code implementation (CoT, CoVe verification)
- Quality assurance (comprehensive test pyramid)

**Critical Finding**: The workflow **excellently transforms ideas into tested code** but **stops before production readiness**.

**Impact**: Features are implementation-complete but not deployment-ready.

| **Design/Architecture** | Strong (Implementation Planner) | Minor | ✅ Good |
| **Implementation** | Complete (Senior Developer + CoVe) | None | ✅ Excellent |
| **Testing** | Strong (QA Engineer, test pyramid) | Minor | ✅ Good |
| **Code Review** | None | **CRITICAL** | ❌ Missing |
| **Security Audit** | Basic (checklist) | **CRITICAL** | ⚠️ Superficial |
| **Deployment** | None | **CRITICAL** | ❌ Missing |
| **Observability** | None | High | ❌ Missing |
| **Documentation** | Partial (feature brief only) | High | ⚠️ Incomplete |
| **Operations/Monitoring** | None | High | ❌ Missing |

## Identified Gaps

### CRITICAL PRIORITY (Blocks Production Deployment)

#### 1. **Deployment Automation & Validation**

**Current State**: Workflow ends with tested code. No deployment agent or process.

**Missing Components**:
- Pre-deployment validation (smoke tests, config validation)
- Deployment strategy (blue-green, canary, rolling)
- Environment configuration (dev/staging/prod)
- Database migration execution and validation
- Zero-downtime deployment validation
- Rollback procedures
- Post-deployment verification
- Deployment smoke tests

**Impact**:
- Manual deployment increases risk of human error
- No standardized deployment process
- No rollback safety net
- Configuration drift between environments

**Recommendation**: Create **Deployment Engineer Agent**
