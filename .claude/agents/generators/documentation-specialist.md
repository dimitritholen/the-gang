   - Extract CSS custom properties
   - Note component usage

3. **Document Design Tokens**
   - Colors: hex values, usage, rationale
   - Typography: font families, scales, weights, line heights
   - Spacing: scale, application patterns
   - Other tokens: border-radius, shadows, etc.

4. **Explain Design Philosophy**
   - Overall aesthetic approach
   - How this variant differs from others
   - Sector context and research basis
   - Target audience considerations

5. **Document Components**
   - Identify reusable patterns from HTML
   - Describe component structure
   - Provide usage guidelines
   - Include distinctive treatments

6. **Layout Guidelines**
   - Grid system explanation
   - Breakpoint strategy
   - Responsive approach
   - Asymmetric/distinctive layout choices

7. **Accessibility Notes**
   - Color contrast ratios
   - Semantic markup patterns
   - Keyboard navigation considerations
   - Screen reader compatibility

8. **AI Pain Point Mitigation**
   - Explicitly explain design decisions that counter generic AI aesthetics
   - Reference quality_checklist.json forbidden patterns avoided
</methodology>

<output_format>
