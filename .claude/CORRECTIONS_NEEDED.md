# Corrections Needed for Claude Code Compliance

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE

All corrections have been successfully applied while preserving ALL sophisticated prompt engineering techniques.

---

## ✅ Completed Items

### 1. Commands - Added YAML Frontmatter + Restored Full Sophisticated Prompts

All commands now have:
- ✅ Proper YAML frontmatter (`allowed-tools:`, `argument-hint:`, `description:`)
- ✅ Complete sophisticated prompt engineering techniques restored
- ✅ Chain-of-Thought reasoning sections
- ✅ Chain-of-Verification checks
- ✅ Step-Back prompting
- ✅ XML-structured outputs
- ✅ "According to..." source grounding
- ✅ Detailed phase-by-phase instructions

**Files Corrected**:
- ✅ `analyze-feature.md` - Has YAML, orchestration pattern correct (90 lines)
- ✅ `gather-requirements.md` - FULLY RESTORED with CoVe, XML, 5-level framework (199 lines)
- ✅ `research-tech.md` - FULLY RESTORED with Step-Back, "According to...", CoVe (216 lines)
- ✅ `plan-implementation.md` - FULLY RESTORED with CoT decomposition, dependency mapping, risk assessment (397 lines)
- ✅ `validate-scope.md` - FULLY RESTORED with MoSCoW, scope creep detection, alignment matrix (325 lines)

### 2. Agents - Added YAML Frontmatter

All agents now have proper YAML frontmatter structure at the top:

```markdown
---
name: {agent-name}
description: {When this agent should be invoked}
tools: Read, Write, Bash, {etc}
model: sonnet
---

{REST OF ORIGINAL CONTENT UNCHANGED}
```

**Files Corrected**:
- ✅ `requirements-analyst.md` - Has YAML header (217 lines)
- ✅ `tech-researcher.md` - Has YAML header (242 lines)
- ✅ `implementation-planner.md` - Has YAML header (380 lines)
- ✅ `scope-guardian.md` - Has YAML header (325 lines)
- ✅ `memory-manager.md` - Has YAML header (372 lines)

---

## What Was Fixed

### Issue 1: Missing YAML Frontmatter ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: All commands and agents were missing the required YAML headers that Claude Code expects.

**Solution**: Added proper YAML frontmatter to all 5 commands and 5 agents with correct parameters.

### Issue 2: Oversimplified Commands ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Commands were initially oversimplified, removing all sophisticated prompt engineering techniques.

**Solution**: Fully restored all commands with:
- Complete methodology from corresponding agents
- Chain-of-Thought sections
- Chain-of-Verification loops
- Step-Back prompting
- XML structures
- "According to..." grounding
- Hallucination prevention
- Best practices
- Success criteria

## File Statistics (After Restoration)

### Commands
1. `analyze-feature.md`: 90 lines (orchestrator)
2. `gather-requirements.md`: 199 lines (5-level framework + CoVe)
3. `research-tech.md`: 216 lines (Step-Back + "According to..." + CoVe)
4. `plan-implementation.md`: 397 lines (CoT + dependency mapping + risk assessment)
5. `validate-scope.md`: 325 lines (MoSCoW + validation frameworks)

### Agents
1. `requirements-analyst.md`: 217 lines
2. `tech-researcher.md`: 242 lines
3. `implementation-planner.md`: 380 lines
4. `scope-guardian.md`: 325 lines
5. `memory-manager.md`: 372 lines

## Key Principle Applied

**DO NOT SIMPLIFY** - The sophisticated prompt engineering (CoT, CoVe, Step-Back, XML) is what makes this workflow powerful.

We ONLY fixed:
1. ✅ Adding YAML headers to all files
2. ✅ Ensuring commands execute workflows directly (not via Task tool delegation)
3. ✅ Restoring full sophisticated prompts that were accidentally simplified

**Everything else preserved!**

## Verification Checklist

- ✅ All commands have proper YAML frontmatter
- ✅ All agents have proper YAML frontmatter
- ✅ All sophisticated prompt engineering techniques preserved
- ✅ Chain-of-Thought reasoning sections intact
- ✅ Chain-of-Verification loops intact
- ✅ Step-Back prompting intact
- ✅ XML-structured outputs intact
- ✅ "According to..." source grounding intact
- ✅ Detailed methodology sections intact
- ✅ code-tools integration patterns correct
- ✅ No agent delegation via Task tool (commands are self-contained)
- ✅ All example templates and frameworks preserved

---

## Files That Are Reference Examples

- `gather-requirements.md` - ✅ Perfect example of how commands should look (5-level framework + CoVe)
- `research-tech.md` - ✅ Perfect example of Step-Back prompting + "According to..." grounding
- `plan-implementation.md` - ✅ Perfect example of CoT decomposition + dependency mapping
- `validate-scope.md` - ✅ Perfect example of MoSCoW + systematic validation
- All agent files - ✅ Correct YAML structure with full sophisticated prompting preserved

---

## Architecture Notes

### Correct Pattern ✅
Commands contain the full methodology inline and execute workflows directly:

```markdown
---
allowed-tools: Bash, Read, Write
argument-hint: [feature-slug]
description: {what command does}
---

# Command Title

**Feature**: $1

{FULL METHODOLOGY WITH ALL SOPHISTICATED TECHNIQUES}:
- Context gathering with code-tools
- Step-by-step process with CoT/CoVe/Step-Back
- XML output structures
- Hallucination prevention
- Best practices
- Success criteria

Begin {workflow} now.
```

### Incorrect Pattern ❌ (Was Fixed)
~~Delegating to agents via Task tool~~ (This doesn't work in Claude Code)

---

## Summary

All corrections completed successfully. The Feature Analysis Workflow is now:
- ✅ Fully compliant with Claude Code architecture
- ✅ Preserves ALL sophisticated prompt engineering techniques
- ✅ Self-contained commands with complete methodology
- ✅ Properly structured agents with YAML headers
- ✅ Ready for use across any project

Total files corrected: **10** (5 commands + 5 agents)
Total lines of sophisticated prompting preserved: **~2,500 lines**
