# Memory Storage

This directory stores project context, requirements, analysis, and planning artifacts generated by the Feature Analysis Workflow.

## Purpose

- Persistent storage of feature analysis artifacts
- Enables context retrieval across sessions
- Supports semantic search for relevant information
- Maintains project knowledge over time

## Artifact Types

- `requirements-*.md` - Feature requirements and specifications
- `tech-analysis-*.md` - Technology research and recommendations
- `implementation-plan-*.md` - Work breakdown structures and task plans
- `scope-validation-*.md` - Scope verification and MVP definitions
- `feature-brief-*.md` - Synthesized summaries of complete analyses
- `checklist-*.md` - Implementation checklists for developers

## Usage

Memory artifacts are created automatically by agents during the feature analysis workflow. They can be retrieved using:

```bash
code-tools search_memory --dir .claude/memory --query "{keywords}" --topk 5
```
