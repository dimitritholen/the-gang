# Requirements: User Authentication System

**Created**: 2025-01-15
**Status**: Approved
**Stakeholders**: Product Team, Security Team, Development Team

## Executive Summary

Implement a secure user authentication system that allows users to register, log in, and manage their accounts. The system must support email/password authentication with JWT-based sessions and include password reset functionality.

## Goals & Objectives

**Primary Goal**: Enable secure user access control for the application

**Secondary Objectives**:

- Reduce unauthorized access attempts
- Improve user onboarding experience
- Meet SOC 2 compliance requirements for authentication

## Functional Requirements

### Core Capabilities

#### FR-001: User Registration

**Description**: Users must be able to create new accounts using email and password

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- [ ] Email validation (format check, uniqueness)
- [ ] Password strength requirements enforced (min 8 chars, 1 uppercase, 1 number, 1 special char)
- [ ] Confirmation email sent upon successful registration
- [ ] Account not activated until email confirmed

**Priority**: High

**User Story**: As a new user, I want to create an account so that I can access personalized features

---

#### FR-002: User Login

**Description**: Registered users must be able to authenticate and access the system

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- [ ] Email and password validation
- [ ] JWT token issued upon successful login
- [ ] Session persists for 7 days or until logout
- [ ] Failed login attempts logged for security monitoring
- [ ] Account locked after 5 failed attempts (30-minute cooldown)

**Priority**: High

**User Story**: As a registered user, I want to log in securely so that I can access my account

---

#### FR-003: Password Reset

**Description**: Users must be able to reset forgotten passwords

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- [ ] Password reset link sent to registered email
- [ ] Reset link expires after 1 hour
- [ ] New password must meet strength requirements
- [ ] Old password invalidated immediately
- [ ] Confirmation email sent after successful reset

**Priority**: High

**User Story**: As a user who forgot my password, I want to reset it via email so that I can regain access

---

#### FR-004: User Logout

**Description**: Users must be able to securely end their session

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- [ ] JWT token invalidated server-side
- [ ] User redirected to login page
- [ ] Session data cleared from client

**Priority**: Medium

**User Story**: As a logged-in user, I want to log out so that others cannot access my account

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance

| ID           | Requirement                | Target Metric | Priority |
| ------------ | -------------------------- | ------------- | -------- |
| NFR-PERF-001 | Login response time        | < 500ms       | High     |
| NFR-PERF-002 | Registration completion    | < 1 second    | Medium   |
| NFR-PERF-003 | Concurrent users supported | 10,000        | High     |

### Security

| ID          | Requirement                                       | Priority |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| NFR-SEC-001 | Passwords hashed with bcrypt (cost factor 12)     | High     |
| NFR-SEC-002 | JWT tokens signed with RS256                      | High     |
| NFR-SEC-003 | HTTPS required for all authentication endpoints   | High     |
| NFR-SEC-004 | Rate limiting: 5 requests/minute per IP for login | Medium   |
| NFR-SEC-005 | Sensitive data (passwords) never logged           | High     |

### Availability

| ID            | Requirement                                       | Priority |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| NFR-AVAIL-001 | 99.9% uptime for authentication service           | High     |
| NFR-AVAIL-002 | Graceful degradation if email service unavailable | Medium   |

### Compliance

| ID           | Requirement                            | Priority |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------- | -------- |
| NFR-COMP-001 | SOC 2 Type II compliant authentication | High     |
| NFR-COMP-002 | GDPR-compliant user data handling      | High     |

## Constraints

- **Timeline**: Must be completed within 3 weeks (Sprint 1-2)
- **Budget**: No budget for third-party authentication services (e.g., Auth0)
- **Technology**: Must integrate with existing Node.js/Express backend
- **Resources**: 2 backend developers, 1 frontend developer available

## Dependencies

- **System Dependencies**:
  - PostgreSQL database for user storage
  - Email service (SendGrid) for confirmation and reset emails
  - Redis for token blacklist (logout invalidation)

- **Feature Dependencies**:
  - User profile management feature will depend on this authentication system

## Out of Scope

The following are explicitly NOT included in this implementation:

- Social login (Google, Facebook, etc.) - Deferred to Phase 2
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) - Deferred to Phase 2
- Biometric authentication - Not planned
- OAuth2 provider capabilities - Not planned
- Single Sign-On (SSO) integration - Deferred to Phase 2
- Remember me functionality - Deferred to Phase 2

## Open Questions

1. **High Priority**: Should we implement email verification throttling to prevent abuse? (Need security team input)
2. **Medium Priority**: What should be the maximum session duration for inactive users?
3. **Low Priority**: Should password reset links be single-use or multi-use within the expiration window?

## Success Criteria

- [ ] 95% of users can successfully register and log in within 2 minutes
- [ ] Zero plaintext passwords stored in database
- [ ] Authentication endpoints respond within 500ms under normal load
- [ ] Password reset flow has < 5% abandonment rate
- [ ] Security audit passes with no critical vulnerabilities
- [ ] SOC 2 compliance requirements for authentication are met
