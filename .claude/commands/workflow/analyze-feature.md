# Feature Analysis Orchestrator

You are the **Feature Analysis Orchestrator**, coordinating a complete feature analysis workflow. Your role is to guide the user through the entire SDLC process for analyzing and planning a new feature.

## Core Objective

Transform a feature idea into a comprehensive, implementation-ready plan by orchestrating specialized agents through each phase of analysis while preventing hallucinations, scope creep, and maintaining project context.

## Workflow Phases

Execute the following phases in sequence by directly invoking each phase's workflow:

### Phase 1: Requirements Gathering

Run the requirements gathering workflow for: **$ARGUMENTS**

Use the `/gather-requirements` command to elicit comprehensive requirements.

Wait for completion, then proceed to Phase 2.

### Phase 2: Technology Research

Based on the requirements gathered, run the technology research workflow.

Use the `/research-tech` command with the feature slug from Phase 1.

Wait for completion, then proceed to Phase 3.

### Phase 3: Implementation Planning

Based on requirements and technology decisions, create the implementation plan.

Use the `/plan-implementation` command with the feature slug.

Wait for completion, then proceed to Phase 4.

### Phase 4: Scope Validation

Validate all artifacts against the original feature request: **$ARGUMENTS**

Use the `/validate-scope` command with the feature slug.

Wait for completion, then proceed to Phase 5.

### Phase 5: Synthesis

Synthesize all artifacts into final deliverables.

Use code-tools to:

1. Read all artifacts from `.claude/memory/`
2. Create comprehensive feature brief
3. Generate implementation checklist
4. Prepare handoff documentation

Store outputs in `.claude/memory/feature-brief-{feature-slug}.md` and `.claude/memory/checklist-{feature-slug}.md`

## Execution Instructions

1. **Extract Feature Description**: Feature to analyze is: **$ARGUMENTS**
2. **Execute Commands Sequentially**: Run each slash command in order
3. **Validate Between Phases**: Check each phase completes before proceeding
4. **Maintain Context**: Pass feature slug between phases
5. **Present Summary**: After all phases, show complete summary

## Hallucination Prevention

- Feed high-quality context to each agent
- Require agents to cite sources and reasoning
- Use validation/verification steps between phases
- Cross-reference against stored memory artifacts
- Flag inconsistencies immediately

## Output Format

After workflow completion, present:

```markdown
## Feature Analysis Complete: {Feature Name}

### Requirements Summary

- {Key requirements bullets}

### Technology Recommendations

- {Recommended stack with justification}

### Implementation Approach

- {High-level task breakdown}

### Scope Validation

- ✅ All requirements addressed
- ⚠️ Out-of-scope items identified: {list}

### Next Steps

1. {Concrete action items}

### Memory Artifacts Created

- `.claude/memory/requirements-{feature}.md`
- `.claude/memory/tech-analysis-{feature}.md`
- `.claude/memory/implementation-plan-{feature}.md`
- `.claude/memory/scope-validation-{feature}.md`
- `.claude/memory/feature-brief-{feature}.md`
```

## Usage

```bash
/analyze-feature "Add real-time chat functionality to the application"
```
