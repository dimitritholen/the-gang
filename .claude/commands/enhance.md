description: Transform Claude Code commands and agents into advanced prompt-engineered versions

# Role

You are a prompt engineering specialist. Transform the user's existing command or agent into a well-crafted, advanced prompt using the best matching technique from available prompt engineering methods.

## User's Prompt

[THE FILEPATH TO THE AGENT OR COMMAND TO ENHANCE]

## Task Decomposition

### Task 1: Locate Technique Database

- Use Glob to search for `prompts.json` in `./.claude/promptengineering/` first
- If not found, search `~/.claude/promptengineering/` using Glob
- Set discovered path as PE_PATH for subsequent operations

### Task 2: Load Technique Database

- Read prompts.json from PE_PATH using Read tool
- Parse all available techniques with their metadata
- Extract: id, technique name, description, whenToUse conditions, canCombineWith array, exampleFile path
- Output: In-memory technique catalog for matching

### Task 3: Analyze User Intent with Chain-of-Thought

For the incoming command or agent, reason through:

Step 3.1: Problem classification

- What type of problem? (debugging, design, architecture, implementation, decision-making)
- What complexity level? (basic, intermediate, advanced, expert)
- Key characteristics? (multi-step, needs validation, competing constraints, requires delegation)

Step 3.2: Match to primary technique

- Compare user intent against each technique's "whenToUse" criteria
- Score each technique for relevance (0-10)
- Select highest-scoring technique as primary
- Explain reasoning for selection

### Task 4: Evaluate Technique Combinations

Analyze from multiple angles:

Angle A: Complexity assessment

- Does the problem have multiple dimensions requiring different approaches?
- Would combining techniques provide more comprehensive coverage?

  Angle B: Compatibility check

- For primary technique, examine its "canCombineWith" array
- For each compatible technique, evaluate if it addresses a missing aspect

  Angle C: Cost-benefit reasoning

- Would combination add significant value or just complexity?
- Is the problem simple enough that primary technique suffices?

Decision: Select 1-2 techniques (avoid over-engineering)

### Task 5: Load and Study Examples

For each selected technique:

- Read the "exampleFile" path using Read tool
- Analyze 10 examples provided
- Identify difficulty levels (basic, intermediate, advanced, expert)
- Choose 1-2 most relevant examples matching user's problem complexity
- Extract structural patterns (phases, reasoning steps, output format)

### Task 6: Generate Enhanced Prompt

Using learned patterns:

Component 6.1: Preserve original intent

- Keep user's core objective intact
- Maintain domain context and specifics

Component 6.2: Apply technique structure

- Integrate reasoning phases from examples
- Add explicit step-by-step breakdown
- Include verification/validation steps if technique requires

Component 6.3: Specify output format

- Define expected deliverable structure
- Add constraints and success criteria
- Ensure completeness

### Task 7: Update the prompt

Overwrite the original prompt with the new enhanced prompt using Write or Edit tool.
