## Overview

Sub-agents are specialized AI assistants that operate with their own context window, domain expertise, and tool access controls. They enable focused, complex reasoning for specific tasks while maintaining separation from the main conversation.

**When to create a sub-agent**:

- Task requires specialized expertise or domain knowledge
- Complex multi-step reasoning is needed
- Different tool access patterns are required
- You need focused, context-specific AI assistance

---

## Architecture Principles

Sub-agents are built on these core principles:

### Separate Context Window

- **Clean slate**: Agent starts with only its prompt and user's task
- **No main conversation history**: Reduces noise and token usage
- **Focused context**: Only relevant information provided
- **Independent reasoning**: Not influenced by prior conversation

### Domain Expertise

- **Specialized knowledge**: Deep expertise in specific area
- **Consistent approach**: Follows defined methodology
- **Best practices**: Embeds domain-specific patterns
- **Reliable output**: Predictable results for task type

### Tool Access Control

- **Security**: Limit tools to necessary subset
- **Efficiency**: Faster execution with fewer options
- **Safety**: Prevent unintended operations
- **Clarity**: Clear boundaries for agent capabilities

### Coordinated Workflows

- **Composable**: Agents can invoke other agents
- **Parallel execution**: Multiple agents work simultaneously
- **Result synthesis**: Combine outputs coherently
- **Clear handoffs**: Well-defined inputs/outputs between agents

### Structured Thinking Pattern

Guide agents through systematic reasoning.

```markdown
<thinking_process>
OODA Loop Decision Framework:

1. **Observe** - Gather comprehensive information
   - Read relevant files
   - Search for patterns
   - Collect context from multiple sources
   - Identify constraints and requirements

2. **Orient** - Understand context and constraints
   - Analyze relationships between components
   - Identify dependencies and assumptions
   - Understand user intent and goals
   - Map problem to known patterns

3. **Decide** - Evaluate options and choose approach
   - Generate multiple solution candidates
   - Assess trade-offs for each option
   - Consider short-term and long-term impacts
   - Select optimal approach with justification

4. **Act** - Implement solution with verification
   - Execute chosen approach systematically
   - Validate at each step
   - Monitor for unexpected issues
   - Provide clear status and results
     </thinking_process>

<verification>
After each major step:
- Verify assumptions are still valid
- Check for unintended consequences
- Validate output meets requirements
- Test edge cases when applicable
- Confirm with user if uncertain
</verification>
```

### Multi-Agent Coordination

```markdown
<coordination_rules>
When working with other agents:

1. **Clear Instructions**
   - Provide specific, unambiguous task descriptions
   - Include all necessary context
   - Define success criteria explicitly
   - Specify expected output format

2. **Context Sharing**
   - Share relevant findings and constraints
   - Provide links to important files/sections
   - Explain decisions that impact other agents
   - Document assumptions made

3. **Avoid Duplication**
   - Check what other agents have done
   - Don't repeat analysis unnecessarily
   - Build on previous work
   - Reference prior findings

4. **Result Synthesis**
   - Combine results coherently when complete
   - Resolve conflicts between agent outputs
   - Provide unified recommendations
   - Highlight areas of agreement/disagreement
     </coordination_rules>

<subagent_creation>
When creating subagents:

- Define focused, single-purpose tasks
- Provide complete context in instructions
- Specify expected deliverables
- Choose appropriate model for complexity
- Limit tool access to necessary subset
  </subagent_creation>
