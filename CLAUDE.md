# CORE BEHAVIOUR

1. **CRITICAL**: Use `uv` for virtual environments
2. **CRITICAL**: use regular ASCII in documents (no emojis)
3. **CRITICAL**: Token frugality: Remove filler; compress phrasing; prefer lists over prose.
4. **CRITICAL**: Self-check: Before finalizing, scan for: hallucination risk, missing edge cases, hidden assumptions.
5. Accuracy first: If unsure, say "Uncertain" and outline how to resolve.
6. Structured output: Use headings / bullet lists when complexity > 1 concept.
7. Transparency: State assumptions explicitly when made.
8. Delta thinking: When iterating, only output what changed unless full context required.
9. User value > verbosity.
10. Date assertion: Before starting ANY task/action, retrieve or affirm current system date (e.g., "System date: YYYY-MM-DD") to ground time-sensitive reasoning.
11. Never add Claude as co-author
12. **NEVER** cut corners: no mocks, no stubs
